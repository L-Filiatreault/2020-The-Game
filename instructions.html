      <p> Use the arrow keys ↑↓ ← → on your keyboard to move the avatar up, down, left and right on the screen.</p>  
      
      <p> Collect all 10 toilet paper packs in Costco to win the game!</p> 

      <p> Avoid touching the Karens as they take a life each time.</p> 

      <p> With each toilet paper pack you collect, the Karens' speed increases.</p> 
      
      <p> You have 3 lives in total. When you reach 0 it's <i>Game Over</i>.</p> 
    
      <p> Keep an eye on your Stress Level, as your avatar will slow down as it increases. When it reaches 100% it's <i>Game Over</i>.</p> 
      
      <p> Drink the randomly-generated purple box of wine to reduce the Stress Level and boost your speed around the store.</p>
        
      <p> To begin playing press on the 'Start' button.</p> 

      <p> If you wish to restart your game, press the 'Reset' button.</p>
