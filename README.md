# 2020: The Game

This project is a 2D game from a top-down view where the user plays a character who is stuck in the dire times of 2020 and the toilet paper shortage. 

The player character (the small pink square) is navigating through a CostCo trying to retrieve 10 toilet paper rolls while avoiding enemies which can kill it upon touch. The player character has 3 lives, and all are used up they are given a 'Game Over'. 

The player character has a stress meter which increases as they navigate the level, and the increase in stress can ultimately slow them down until it's a game over. The cure for the stress are 'boxes of wine' which are purple squares that randomly spawn all over the level.

This game was created for the final project for Web Programming I class. It is demonstrating using features including: array processing, animation in Canvas, scoring, a game-ending condition, and sounds. 

*Objectives of this project*

- To apply extensive knowledge of the JavaScript language acquired in Web Programming I
- To create a 2D game using HTML (Canvas) and CSS
- To build a game with Object-Oriented Programming
